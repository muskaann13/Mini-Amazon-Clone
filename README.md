# Mini-Amazon-Clone
An interactive, responsive <b>Amazon-style demo app</b> built purely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript â€” enhanced by real-time backend 'fetch' calls and persisting cart data via localStorage.

<b>Step through the door of your personalized miniâ€‘Amazon â€” a full-stack demo created from scratch that turns static markup into a dynamic, dataâ€‘driven shopping experience.</b>

As part of the JavaScript Full Course by SuperSimpleDev, this project is a complete Amazonâ€‘style frontend demo that dynamically retrieves products and handles cart, checkout, orders, and tracking functionalityâ€”entirely built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

ðŸ”§<b> Key Features</b><br/>
<b>Dynamic product catalog<b> fetched from a mock backend API using fetch() and async/await, with error handling as taught in the SuperSimpleDev course.

<b>Add-to-cart logic<b> powered by arrayâ€‘based cart items, using data attributes and quantity adjustment logic (increase/decrease). Cart state persists in localStorage, allowing user sessions to continue across page reloads.

<b>Checkout & order flow:<b> pricing breakdown, delivery options, real-time shipping cost calculations, and final order placement via POST request to the backend. Order data and tracking parameters (id/status) rendered on a confirmation page.

<b>Modular code structure:<b> separated into products.js, cart.js, checkout.js as ESâ€‘modules; utility files for formatting (e.g. currency), DOM rendering, and date formatting via Day.js. OOP patternsâ€”such as classes for Product and Cartâ€”were implemented during later course sections as recommended.

ðŸ§  <b>Learning Outcomes</b><br/>
<b>Gained strengths in DOM manipulation:<b> generating HTML content dynamically in loops, binding event listeners, and styling stateful components (buttons, product cards, cart badges).

<b>Built fluency in JavaScript fundamentals and advanced topics:<b> promises, fetch, module imports/exports, error catching, closures, and objectâ€‘oriented design.

<b>Applied realâ€‘world patterns in a realistic eâ€‘commerce UI<b> (product grid, responsive layout, cart updates), inspired by the course walkthroughs that build an Amazonâ€‘like website using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

<b>Tech Stack:</b> HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), ES6+ JavaScript (Modules), fetch API, localStorage, Day.js (for dates), Promise/async-await.

<b>Project Purpose:</b><br/>
This was a handsâ€‘on learning exercise guided by SuperSimpleDevâ€™s fullâ€‘stack JavaScript curriculum. It reinforced everything from building a responsive site layout to integrating front-end calls with a simulated backend. What started as static product cards evolved into a fully interactive, stateful mini-e-commerce application.
